Snake vs Block Game
AP Final Project
About Project
As our final project for Advanced Programming (AP) project, we have made a replica of the famous game Snake vs Block. In this game, there is a snake which the user can control to obtain tokens which increases the size of the snake. The player then collides with the snake against walls of varying lengths. The the bigger the block broken, the higher the score. There are also various features such as Walls, Magnets, Shields and Bombs in the game!
